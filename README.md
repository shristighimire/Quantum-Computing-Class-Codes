## Files and Their Purpose

### `complexnumbers.py`
This script focuses on:
- Operations with complex numbers.
- Demonstrating their use in quantum mechanics and quantum gates.

### Future Additions
- Quantum Gates (e.g., Hadamard, Pauli-X, CNOT)
- Quantum Algorithms (e.g., Grover's, Shor's)
- Simulations using Python libraries (e.g., Qiskit)
